/*

In this exercise you'll be creating your own custom task class. Instead of
configuring ad-hoc tasks in a build script, we can define a task as a regular
Java or Groovy class that can then be reused throughout your build scripts.
Remember, a Gradle build script is just a Groovy script, so you can write your
class definition in-line in the script itself.

Exercises:

1. Define a new task class named "HelloTask"
2. Define a task action for your new task that simply prints the string
   "Executing my custom task." to the console.
3. Create a new task in your build script of type HelloTask named "hello".
4. Run the "hello" task and observe the output.

*/

// 1. Defined a task class
class MyTask extends DefaultTask{

	// Creating a name property for this task	
	String firstName
	// 2. Defined a task action for the new task class
	@TaskAction
	void doAction() {
		println "Executing a custom task for $firstName"
	}

}

// 3. Created an instance of the custom task
task hello(type: MyTask){
	// Setting the name property of the MyTask instance
	firstName = "Mike"
} 

// 4. Executed the task within the command line. Executed sucessfully.
